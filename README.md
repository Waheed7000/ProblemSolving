## 📌 About the Repository

This repository serves as a personal archive of my problem-solving journey across various competitive programming platforms.  
aims to:

- To showcase my coding and problem-solving skills from one central place.
- To keep my solutions well-organized and easy to revisit in the future.
- To help others searching for explanations or approaches to specific problems I’ve already solved.
- To act as a personal reference with written breakdowns of solutions I may forget over time.

Each problem folder typically contains a clean implementation, and in most cases, an explanation written in its own `README.md`.

**Profiles:**  
[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/deehaw)  
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/Waheed7000/)

## ⚙️ Languages & Tools

- **Main Language:** C++
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code

## 📝 Problem Format & Naming

- Each problem is placed in its own folder under the relevant platform.
- File names match the problem title to improve readability and searchability.
- Each solution file may include a comment with the problem link (in future updates).
- The individual problem's `README.md` file explains the logic and thought process behind the solution.

## 🧠 Notes & Future Improvements

- Some early solutions may need optimization or cleaner structure.
- Over time, I plan to improve code readability and add explanations to all existing solutions.
- This is a personal archive, but feel free to fork or clone it for educational purposes.
